# Lessons Learned

# Approach:
Originally set out to build an application where a user could look for hiking trails in their local area
and see possible ratings, pictures and level of difficulty.  
Once the team set out we thought it would be nice to have an index card displayed for each trail with a picture and some 
high level information.  Upon reviewing a card, if interested, a user could then select a link on a particular card to see additional detail informaiton on the trail.  In addition, you would be provided a google map for the location of the trail that provides the ability to view the trail.

Additional features are being added to have users select and save favorite trails that can later be retrieved as a list of favorites.
